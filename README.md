# ml-chess
To run this ML Chess Engine, make sure you have installed all the required dependencies. Then, run the file GUI.py to play against the bot. This bot uses deep CNNs (or what was considered deep in 2021) in order to replicate the performance of traditional chess engines. The neural network outputs a probabilitic tensor encoding which maps to moves that the engine can play.
